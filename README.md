# Gem-hunt-HCMUS
Gem Hunter Puzzle Solver
=========================

Description
-----------
This project implements a Gem Hunter puzzle solver using three different approaches:
1. PySAT-based CNF solving
2. Brute Force search
3. Backtracking search

The puzzle involves a grid where:
  - Numeric cells represent the number of adjacent traps.
  - Unknown cells (marked as '_') need to be assigned either a trap ('T') or a gem ('G').
  - Pre-assigned cells may be traps ('T') or gems ('G').
  
The program reads an input grid from a text file, solves the puzzle using the selected algorithm,
and writes the solved grid along with statistics (e.g., number of CNF clauses, number of traps, goals,
total filled cells, and the time consumed) to an output file.

Extra Libraries
---------------
This project uses the following external libraries:
  - python-sat: For solving CNF formulas using the PySAT library.

To install the required library, run:
  pip install python-sat

Usage
-----
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
2. Ensure your input files (e.g., input5x5.txt, input11x11.txt, etc.) are in the project directory
   or in a designated folder (update the input file path accordingly when prompted).
3. Run the solver using Python(VS Code terminal):
   python main.py

4. When prompted, choose one of the options from the menu:
   - 1) Solve using PySAT
   - 2) Solve using Brute Force
   - 3) Solve using Backtracking
   - 4) Exit

5. Enter the input file path when prompted (e.g., infos/input5x5.txt).
6. After the solution is computed, youâ€™ll be asked to provide an output file path to save the
   solution and statistics.

Notes
-----
- The Brute Force and Backtracking methods may be very slow for larger puzzles with many unknowns.
- For better performance, use the PySAT solver when possible.
- The output file will contain both the solved grid and a statistics section at the end.
